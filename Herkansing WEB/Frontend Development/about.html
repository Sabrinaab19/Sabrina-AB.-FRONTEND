        <p> This picture is taken on the Dam Square in Amsterdam. It was one of the first pictures I took with my new iPhone 7 Plus. I wanted to test out the quality of the camera, and I happened to sit on a bench on the Dam Square. I took out my phone and took some pictures of the pigeons, which there are way too many of in Amsterdam.</p>
